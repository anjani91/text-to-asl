## Project Description
Text-to-ASL is a web application designed to translate text and speech into American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. This tool helps bridge communication gaps for individuals with hearing impairments by providing visual representations of ASL signs. It enables real-time translation of written or spoken input into animated ASL signs, making communication more accessible and inclusive.

## The Problem Statement
Thereâ€™s a gap in communication for those with hearing impairments, and the current technology doesnâ€™t provide efficient, real-time ASL translation that is easily accessible to everyone.

## The Solution
The solution is an intuitive web app that allows users to enter text or speech, and it will automatically translate into animated ASL gestures, helping to break down communication barriers.
